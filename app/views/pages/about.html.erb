    <h1> Welcome to the Zelda Quiz</h1>
    <p>I decided to do this page to practice my skills creating in the digital world</p>

    <p>If you don't like it...I understand! Then share it to your enemiesðŸ‘¹</p>

    <h3>DISCLAIMER!!!</h3>
    <p>One little thing. I don't own any property of Zelda or Nintendo's games. <br> I will not charge or make any money out of this game. Again, it is just for practicing.<br> Nintendo don't get mad! I just love the Zelda universe so much :)</p>
